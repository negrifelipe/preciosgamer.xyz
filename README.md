Gaming stores prices in a single place

## Running the solution

There is a `docker compose` that will set up all the infrastructure you need to run the solution without configuring anything.

This will run:

- PostgreSQL
- RabbitMQ
- Nginx

```
docker compose up
```

Then you can run each project separately using your IDE.
